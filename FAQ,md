# The Exotic Tools FAQs

**Q: Does this script use a token?**  
A: Yes, there’s no other way to interact with Discord’s API without a token. Since it uses a token, I have no access to your password. But don’t worry—I guarantee this is safe. If anyone is hoping for people to get hacked, sorry to disappoint—no one is getting hacked. If you’re still paranoid, just enable 2FA or use SMS verification. 

**Q: Why is this free?**  
A: I actually have a personal motive. I’ve been criticizing the game’s design, especially its mapping system, I will keep supporting this script for any players who want it until the devs completely change the way mindless clicking works. However instead of pushing the devs to rethink their design, y’all are busy accusing each other. What’s the point?

**Q: Is this a virus? Or something harmful or risky for me?**  
A: There’s no bad intent here if you actually understand my motive. The devs could **remove every advantage from** tech-savvy players if they started thinking about QoL for mapping. At the very least, you can check it out here: [github.com/devilsadvocate101/SENTINEL/blob/main/proof/0226.mp4]. I made a screen recording just for you all. This script simply does what it’s meant to do, nothing more. I won’t have access to your credit card info, your geo-location, or whatever else you’re paranoid about. And of course, your device isn’t going to explode—relax, it’s not that deep.

**Q: Are you a dev in disguise, or is this some kind of trap from them?**  
A: Since when have the Isekaid devs ever put in this much effort? They show up like once a century, and even then, it’s just to drop a buggy update. And those bugs? Yeah, they’ll probably get fixed in like 2-3 months… or longer LOL.

**Q: How is this different from a regular autoclicker?**  
A: This script has a ton of error handling and dozens of conditional cases to prevent unwanted issues. It also has spam protection, so you don’t have to worry—Discord won’t ban you, even if you map nonstop for a whole month.    

**Q: Can the devs detect this?**  
A: Yes and no—it depends on how smart they are. At best, they’d just guess based on click count. The truth is, they low-key don’t care about autoclickers as long as their cash items sell. The real challenge for Discord bot developers in detecting cheaters is that they’re operating *on* Discord’s platform. They don’t interact directly with players; Discord acts as the middleman. So there’s no anti-cheat system that goes as deep as kernel-level detection.

**Q: Can I ask you something?**  
A: Of course, ask me anything—I’ll answer as best as I can. My DMs are always open, and your privacy is guaranteed.
